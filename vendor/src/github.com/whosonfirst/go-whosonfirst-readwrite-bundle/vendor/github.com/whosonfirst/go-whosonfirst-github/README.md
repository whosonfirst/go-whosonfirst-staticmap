# go-whosonfirst-github

Go package for working with Who's On First GitHub repositories.

## Tools

### Webhooks

_All of the webhook tools need some documentation loving..._

#### wof-create-hook

_Please write me_

```
./bin/wof-create-hook -token {TOKEN} -hook-url {URL} -hook-secret {SECRET} -org whosonfirst-data -repo whosonfirst-data-venue-us-il
```

You can also create webhooks for all of the repositories in an organization by passing the `-repo '*'` flag. You can still filter the list of repos by setting the `-prefix` flag.

```
./bin/wof-create-hook -token {TOKEN} -hook-url {URL} -hook-secret {SECRET} -org whosonfirst-data -repo '*' -prefix whosonfirst-data

## Caveats

### Things this package doesn't deal with (yet)

* Anything that requires a GitHub API access token
* Anything other than the `master` branch of a repository
* The ability to exclude specific repositories
